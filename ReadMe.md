House Price Prediction Program
Overview
This program is a beginner-level project in predictive analytics that uses a machine learning model to estimate house prices based on key features such as overall quality, living area, garage capacity, basement size, and the year the house was built. It is built using Python and Scikit-learn, making it a simple yet effective introduction to real-world machine learning applications.

The program trains a linear regression model on housing data and allows users to input house details through the console to get a price prediction. This project is ideal for students, enthusiasts, or professionals looking to understand predictive modeling and its practical applications in the housing sector.

Key Features
Predictive Analytics:

The program uses a machine learning model to estimate house prices based on input features.
It employs a simple linear regression model trained on a dataset of housing prices.
User Interaction:

Users can input key details about a house (e.g., quality, area, year built) and receive a predicted price in real-time.
Model Training and Evaluation:

The program trains the model on historical housing data.
It evaluates the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure reliable predictions.
How It Works
Dataset:

The program uses a dataset of historical house sales, which includes features like house size, quality, and garage capacity.
The data is preprocessed to include only relevant columns and remove any missing or inconsistent values.
Model Training:

The program splits the data into training and testing sets.
A linear regression model is trained to learn the relationship between house features and sale prices.
User Prediction:

Users are prompted to input details about a house.
The program uses the trained model to predict the price based on the provided input.
Usefulness in the Housing Sector
This program demonstrates the potential of predictive analytics in the housing market:

For Buyers:

Buyers can estimate a reasonable price for a house based on its features before making an offer.
This reduces the risk of overpaying for a property.
For Sellers:

Sellers can use the tool to determine a competitive listing price for their property.
It helps ensure pricing aligns with market trends and property attributes.
For Real Estate Agents:

Agents can use the program to quickly provide clients with an estimate based on property features.
It streamlines the process of pricing and negotiation.
For Market Analysis:

Real estate companies can integrate predictive models to analyze market trends and predict future price fluctuations.
This supports data-driven decision-making in property investments.
Technologies Used
Frontend: Console-based interface for simplicity.
Backend: Python with the following libraries:
Pandas: For data loading and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
